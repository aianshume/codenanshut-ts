## 🤔 Is this Course Right for Me?

This course starts at the beginner level 🟢 and progresses to intermediate in the hands-on projects. It assumes you have some basic knowledge of web programming with familiarity of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It is fast-paced and similar to [my style on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/codeNanshu), but far more in-depth and followed in a long linear format.
